# Setup Instructions for Dynamic.IO Website

This guide will help you set up and run the Dynamic.IO website on your local machine.

## Prerequisites Installation

### 1. Install Node.js

Since Node.js is not currently installed on your system, you'll need to install it first.

#### For macOS:
**Option A: Using Homebrew (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js
brew install node
```

**Option B: Download from Official Website**
1. Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version (recommended)
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions

**Option C: Using Node Version Manager (nvm)**
```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Restart your terminal or run:
source ~/.zshrc

# Install latest LTS Node.js
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

### 2. Verify Installation

After installing Node.js, verify it's working:

```bash

You should see version numbers for both commands.
